# CP3407 Project Assignment 
## Group 10 - ChatBot
Welcome to the repository for the JCU Orientation Chatbot, an interactive chatbot designed to assist new students starting their orientation at James Cook University [ JCU ]. Instead of searching through the extensive JCU website, students can get instant answers to their orientation-related questions from one place. This chatbot is built using JavaScript, HTML and JSON to create a seamless and engageing experience for students. It is designed to be integrated directly into the JCU website, providing real-time support for queries about campus resources, orientation schedules, student services and more.
